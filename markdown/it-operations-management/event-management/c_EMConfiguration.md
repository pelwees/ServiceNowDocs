# Event Management setup

After activating Event Management, set it up to receive and process events, and generate and analyze alerts.

## Event Management setup without using guided setup

Set up Event Management by completing these tasks in the following order:

1.  Configure a [MID Server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md) to receive and process events via the MID Server.
2.  [Configure the MID Web Server extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/../task/configure-mid-web-server-extension.md).
3.  Configure [Configure Event Management connectors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/../reference/connectors-and-listeners.md).
4.  Configure [event field mappings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/c_EMEventFieldMapping.md) and [Binding alerts to CIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/ci-binding-alert.md) to manage alert generation.
5.  [Alert management rules for resolving alerts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/alert-management-rule.md), perform, and [CI remediation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/../task/t_SACreateCIRemediation.md) for alert management.
6.  [Request Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/../../service-mapping/task/t_ActivateServiceMappingPlugin.md) and get a top-down [discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/../task/t_EMGetBaselineServiceMapping.md) to receive CI relationships for software and hardware.
7.  Configure [impact calculation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/c_EMImpactCalculation.md) for services, to establish priority for alert resolution.
8.  Configure [alert groups](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/event-management/../task/t_EMCreateAlertGroup.md) to consolidate related alerts.
9.  Configure the Predictive Intelligence plugin \(com.glide.platform\_ml\) to enable machine learning and finding similar alerts.
10. Configure any other general tasks that appear in this section as appropriate.

**Note:** Event Management does not support creating incidents on remote instances.
