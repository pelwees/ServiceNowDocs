# Security Operations Integration- Isolate Host capability

The **Isolate Host** capability restricts system connections to other devices. Isolate host is executed against a configuration item \(CI\).

The **Isolate Host** capability has a flow, [Security Operations - Isolate Host Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/../../security-operations-integrations/task/secops-integration-isolate-host-workflow.md) that accepts one or more CIs and optionally an implementation. You can specify an implementation to use to isolate the host or for the flow to attempt to isolate the host using all implementations.

**Note:** While not integrated with a capability, a flow, [Security Operations Carbon Black Integration- Remove Host Isolation Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/../../security-operations-integrations/task/secops-integration-cb-remove-host-isolation-workflow.md) is available for orchestration to restore communication with an isolated host.

**Note:** If no implementations are available, capability actions are not displayed in product menus.
