# Flow-based Playbooks

Using the Flow Designer, security administrators and flow design authors can more easily transition from manual or undocumented playbooks to automated and repeatable playbooks. The drag-and-drop feature provides flexibility in moving objects, condition checks, parallel branching, decision tables, and more.

Security Incident Response provides the following playbooks with the base system.

In addition to the listed playbooks, there are also subflows in Security Operations Spoke that can be called from the flows playbook. Ransomware is one of that subflows.

Activate these flows before you use them. For more information, see [Activate a Security Incident Response flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pelwees/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/security-incident-response/../task/getting-started-phishing-playbook.md).
