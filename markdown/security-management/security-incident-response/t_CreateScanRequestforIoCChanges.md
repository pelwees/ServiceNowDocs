# Create Lookup Request for IoC Changes workflow

The **Security Incident Response - Create Lookup Request for IoC Changes** flow is triggered by a business rule to run automatically when an IoC is added or changed. Malware scans are triggered only when new data is entered and only the new data is scanned.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.basic

## About this task

If the IoC is empty, the workflow does not run. Historical scans are retained and viewable in the **Security Scan Requests** tab and worknotes of the security incident. The existing security incidents are automatically updated.

**Important:**

The **Security Incident Response - Create Lookup Request for IoC Changes** workflow is migrated to the Flow Designer. The flow gets triggered only when the sn\_ti\_scanner has at least one record.

The Flow Designer actions include:
